        <h2>About Blood Donation Management System</h2>
        <p>
            Universally, 'Blood' is recognized as the most precious element that sustains life. It saves
            innumerable lives across the world in a variety of conditions. Once in every 2- seconds,
            someone, somewhere is desperately in need of blood. More than 29 million units of blood
            components are transfused every year. The need for blood is great - on any given day,
            approximately 39,000 units of Red Blood Cells are needed. Each year, we could meet only up to 1%
            (approx) of our nation’s demand for blood transfusion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite the increase in the number of donors, blood remains in short supply during emergencies,
            mainly attributed to the lack of information and accessibility. We positively believe this tool
            can overcome most of these challenges by effectively connecting the blood donors with the blood
            recipients.
        </p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            Over the past few years, India has been focused on improving health indicators across rural and
            urban areas. However, ensuring safe and adequate blood, which is fundamental to our healthcare
            system, remains a huge challenge and a gap area. Despite all its efforts, India fell short of
            1.9 million units of blood in 2017-18 – equivalent to 60 tankers. Even today, India is heavily
            dependent on replacement blood donation, wherein family or friends are asked to donate blood in
            lieu of the units given to a patient. A culture of voluntary blood donation remains a distant
            dream in India – predominantly because of the misconceptions, misinformation and a lack of a
            centralized unified system that will monitor blood stocks and connect available sources to
            destinations in need. We positively believe this tool can overcome most of these challenges by
            effectively connecting the blood donors with the blood recipients.
        </p>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            Transfusion of blood and blood components is an established standard of treating patients who
            are deficient in one or more blood constituents and is therefore an essential part of health
            care. A blood transfusion service is a complex organization requiring careful design and
            management. Essential functions of a blood transfusion service are donor recruitment, blood
            collection, testing of donor blood, component preparation and supply of these components to the
            patients. The organization of a blood transfusion service should receive utmost attention and
            care for smooth functioning of various components of the service. The goal of blood transfusion
            service is to provide effective blood and blood components which are as safe as possible and
            adequate to meet the patients' needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a blood transfusion service deals with different functions related to donors and
            patients, it is imperative to keep in mind the safety of both donors and recipients. The blood
            transfusion service has to be planned and organized in such a way that it fulfils its ideal aims
            and objectives i.e.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Recruitment of blood donors - voluntary and replacement.
            </li>
            <li>
                Care of donor, donated unit and the recipient.

            </li>
            <li>
                Provide clinically effective blood components.
            </li>
            <li>
                Optimal use of available blood.
